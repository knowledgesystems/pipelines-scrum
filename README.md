# pipelines-scrum
This repository is used to track tasks that cannot be directly assigned to an existing cbioportal/knowledgesystems codebase. e.g exploring jenkins for integration tests

To track tasks, create a new issue and add the `pipelines-scrum` tag. If urgent, new cards can be categorized as an interrupt with the `interrupt` tag. Locate the newly generated card in ZenHub and drag to the appropriate column. Do not place new tasks directly into the sprint backog unless it is an interrupt.
